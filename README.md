# 🚀 Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing (SDS)

This project trains an AI agent to **land a spaceship safely** using **Deep Q-Learning**, a powerful reinforcement learning technique.  

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Using the `LunarLander-v3` environment from Gymnasium, the AI learns to:

- Understand its current position and status (state)
- Decide the best action (fire main engine, side engines, or do nothing)
- Collect rewards or penalties
- Improve over time through deep neural networks and experience replay

The learning process mimics human trial-and-error behavior, where each decision affects future outcomes.
